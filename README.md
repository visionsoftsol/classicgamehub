Live website: https://classicgamehub.com

ClassicGameHub is a collection of browser-based classic and mathematical games implemented using JavaScript.  
All games run instantly in the browser and require no installation, login, or plugins.

The goal of the project is to recreate timeless puzzle and logic games in a clean, fast, distraction-free web experience.

## Why This Project Exists

Many classic puzzle games are either locked behind apps, ads, or complex interfaces.  
This project aims to provide simple playable versions that open instantly in a browser tab.

We created Classic Game Hub to bring back the joy of classic games that have entertained generations. In a world of complex modern gaming, we believe there's beauty in simplicity. These timeless games offer pure fun without overwhelming graphics or complicated rules - perfect for creating new memories while honoring the games that shaped our childhoods.

## Development Notes

Each game is implemented independently and does not require server communication.  
Game state, timers, and board logic are handled entirely inside the browser.

This makes the site easy to deploy and highly cacheable through CDN distribution.

## Future Plans

- Additional puzzle and logic games
- More mathematical challenges
- Performance improvements
- Improved mobile interaction
